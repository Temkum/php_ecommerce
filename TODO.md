# PHP eCommerce with MVC OOP

Want to add an htaccess file to prevent users from accessing the app folder

Next make sure the website is viewed from the index.php page to avoid add ?? in the url ie in order to have clean URLs - we add an htaccess file which controls how requests are handled

use print_r() to view objects and debugging

created a class with default method since it's used nowhere else
then with a constructor that runs immediately

- creating views

* connect template to our mvc
* add assets

* login and signup page
  You could redirect user to the 404 page if the page doesn't exist or link is broken

* Posting on login and signup
